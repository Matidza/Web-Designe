## Introduction to HTML

HTML is the standard markup language used to create the structure of a web page. It defines the elements and their attributes that make up the content of a webpage. HTML documents are composed of tags, which are enclosed in angle brackets `< >`. Every web page begins with the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration and contains the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` elements.

## HTML Basics

### Elements and Tags

HTML elements are the building blocks of a webpage. Tags surround content and provide structure. Common HTML elements include headings `<h1>`, paragraphs `<p>`, links `<a>`, images `<img>`, and lists `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`.

### Attributes

Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. They are always included in the opening tag and come in name/value pairs. For example, the `href` attribute in the `<a>` tag defines the link's destination.

## Introduction to CSS

CSS is a style sheet language used to control the presentation of HTML documents. It allows you to define styles, layout, and design aspects of your webpage. CSS uses selectors to target HTML elements and declarations to specify the styling properties.

## CSS Basics

### Selectors

Selectors are patterns used to select and style HTML elements. They can be based on element names, classes, IDs, attributes, or relationships between elements. For example, to select all paragraphs, you can use the selector `p`.

### Properties and Values

CSS properties define the style of an element, and values set the specific styling. Properties like `color`, `font-size`, and `margin` control aspects such as text color, font size, and spacing.

## Responsive Web Design

Responsive web design ensures that a webpage looks good on various devices and screen sizes. Media queries in CSS enable you to apply different styles based on the device characteristics.

## Additional CSS Features

### Flexbox and Grid

Flexbox and Grid are layout models in CSS that allow you to design complex and responsive layouts. Flexbox is ideal for one-dimensional layouts, while Grid is suitable for two-dimensional layouts.

### Transitions and Animations

CSS transitions and animations provide dynamic effects to elements. Transitions smoothly change property values, while animations create more complex, timed effects.
