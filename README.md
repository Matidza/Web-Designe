## Introduction to React

React is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications where data dynamically changes over time. It allows developers to create large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes.

## React Basics

### JSX

JSX (JavaScript XML) allows you to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without using methods like `createElement()` or `appendChild()`. JSX makes your code simpler and more readable.

### Components

Components are the building blocks of a React application. They can be functional or class-based, and each component manages its own state and lifecycle. Components can be nested, managed, and handled independently.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

export default Welcome;
```

## Component Lifecycle

React components go through a lifecycle of events:

1. **Mounting**: When the component is created and inserted into the DOM.
2. **Updating**: When the component updates as a result of changes to props or state.
3. **Unmounting**: When the component is removed from the DOM.

### Lifecycle Methods

For class components, lifecycle methods include `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`. Hooks like `useEffect` can be used to manage lifecycle events in functional components.

## State and Props

### State

State is an object that determines how a component renders and behaves. It can be changed asynchronously, and when it does, the component re-renders.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

### Props

Props (short for properties) are read-only attributes passed from a parent component to a child component. They allow data to flow between components.

```jsx
function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

## Handling Events

Handling events in React is similar to handling events on DOM elements. However, events in React are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.

```jsx
function ActionButton() {
  function handleClick() {
    alert('Button clicked!');
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>
  );
}
```

## React Router

React Router is a standard library for routing in React. It enables the navigation among views of various components in a React application, allows changing the browser URL, and keeps the UI in sync with the URL.

```jsx
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Switch>
        <Route path="/" exact component={Home} />
        <Route path="/about" component={About} />
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  );
}
```

## State Management

State management is crucial in large applications. React provides Context API for simple state management, and libraries like Redux or MobX for more complex state management scenarios.

### Context API

The Context API provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

```jsx
import React, { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react';

const MyContext = createContext();

function MyProvider({ children }) {
  const [state, setState] = useState('some value');

  return (
    <MyContext.Provider value={{ state, setState }}>
      {children}
    </MyContext.Provider>
  );
}

function MyComponent() {
  const { state, setState } = useContext(MyContext);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{state}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setState('new value')}>Change Value</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Hooks

Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. The most commonly used hooks are `useState` and `useEffect`.

### useState

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### useEffect

```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  }, [count]);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
